# Email Microservice

This is a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restful) [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) application that is handling sending emails.

Just send an email to the API via POST and don't care about the implementation details.

It is especially useful in an environment with multiple applications where sending emails is tedious because you have to deal with multiple implementations and configurations. The service will decouple and centralize sending emails across applications in your company.
